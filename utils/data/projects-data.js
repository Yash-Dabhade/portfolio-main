I created the UI using NextJS, Typescript, MUI, TailwindCSS, Google Maps, Sun-Editor, and React Slick. The app supports multiple languages and currencies. I developed the API using NestJS, Typescript, MySQL, TypeORM, AWS, and Nodemailer. I deployed the front-end app to AWS Amplify and the back-end app to AWS EC2.",
